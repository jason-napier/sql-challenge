README Module 9
This is a mock research project about people whom the company Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s. This information was collected from six .csv files and analyzed.
First, an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables was created.
Secondly, tables with data types, primary, and foreign keys were created.
Finally, data analysis was preformed by deriving tables based upon requests for data.

Files:
* Data folder:
    A folder containing six .csv files which are loaded for the data.
* Entity Relation Diagram.png:
    An Entity Relation Diagram of how the tables interconnect.
* Create Tables.sql
	A SQL query that initializes tables.
* Data Analysis.sql
	A SQL query that runs analysis.
