# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis
Repository for Module 9 Challenge

## Overview

This project involved reconstructing the historical employee database for Pewlett Hackard, focusing on the period of the 1980s and 1990s. Tasked with the roles of a data engineer and analyst, I navigated through the complexities of database design, data engineering, and data analysis. The project was conducted in three primary phases: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis, working with archival data spread across six CSV files.

## Phase 1: Data Modeling

### Objective

- Inspect the CSV files to understand the data structure.
- Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the database schema.

### Tools Used

- QuickDBD for ERD design.

### Approach

- Analyzed each CSV file to identify primary keys, data types, and relationships.
- Constructed the ERD, ensuring the normalization of tables and establishing relationships through primary and foreign keys.

## Phase 2: Data Engineering

### Objective

- Develop a table schema for each CSV file.
- Import the data into a SQL database.

### Tools Used

- SQL for schema creation and data import.

### Approach

- Defined table schemas in SQL, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Imported each CSV file into its corresponding table within the SQL database, adhering to the order of table creation to manage foreign keys effectively.

## Phase 3: Data Analysis

### Objective

- Perform a series of SQL queries to answer specific questions about the employees.

### Queries Conducted

1. Employee demographics and salaries.
2. Employees hired in 1986.
3. Managers for each department.
4. Department listings for each employee.
5. Employees named Hercules with last names starting with "B".
6. Employees in the Sales department.
7. Employees in both Sales and Development departments.
8. Frequency counts of employee last names.

## Conclusion

This project illuminated the historical staffing patterns and salary distributions at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. By reconstructing the employee database and conducting a thorough analysis, we gained valuable insights into the company's operational history. The exercise not only showcased the power of SQL in managing and analyzing large datasets but also underscored the importance of data engineering in preserving organizational memory.
